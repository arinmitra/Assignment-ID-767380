## The Jupyter Notebooks expects the following files to run smoothly
1. 'Insurance .csv' (as the starting file. Also note that there is a space in the starting file name which has been cleaned as a part of the cleansing exercise)
2. The other files like 'Insurance_clean.csv' and 'Insurance_clean2.csv' will be created once the notebooks run successfully
3. The Jupyter notebooks will have to be run in sequence individually to get no error. For e.g. in order to run the notebook for Exercise 1 and all tasks thereof, named as 'Assignment-ID-767380-Exercise1-Tasks1thru3', successfully, we will need to upload the data file 'Insurance .csv' so that it can be made available to the first set of program steps in the notebook.
