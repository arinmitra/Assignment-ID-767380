## The Jupyter Notebooks expects the following files to run smoothly
1. 'Insurance .csv' (as the starting file. Also note that there is a space in the starting file name which has been cleaned as a part of the cleansing exercise)
2. The other files like 'Insurance_clean.csv' and 'Insurance_clean2.csv' will be created once the notebooks run successfully
